Hi, I am a graduate student at the University of Washington, Seattle, studying Transportation Engineering. Most of my work involves dealing with big data in Transportation and Traffic Engineering and use different machine and deep learning tools to convert this data into valuable information. I also work on the algorithmic side of connected and autonomous vehicle related research.

With the DSSG, I will be a part of the ORCA team and will be working with the ORCA electronic smart card data to understand the transfer related patterns and the statistical bias in this data.
