Hello, my name is Hillary Dawkins and I recently finished my Masters in physics at the University of Waterloo. My research focus was in quantum information and particularly fault-tolerant computation schemes and noise characterization. We used simulations of quantum systems to develop new fault-tolerant protocols. I also have an interest in physics education research, and recently spent some time working at the Open University in the UK with a physics education group. We studied the impact of question structure on student performance and demographic gaps in attainment. 

I’m very excited to be a part of the DSSG program this summer on the Visualizing Equity team. Our goal is to build a tool which will help the public, urban planners, and community leaders better understand the distribution of resources throughout Seattle.
